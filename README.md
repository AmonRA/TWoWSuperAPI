### Optional addon. It is recommended for addon makers to read this to get a gift of some of the mod's features

What it does:
- Makes holding shift turn on autoloot (The mod disables that and adds a command to toggle on/off autoloot. This addon types that command for you every time you hold shift to regain that functionality. You can always go into the addon's files & delete this feature and do your autolooting however you want)
- Add "mouseover" support to all default blizzard unitframes
- Show item charges in bag
- Shift click a spell in your spellbook to link it to chat
- Add chat command to toggle showing unit names or GUIDs in combat log
